# Commit Conventions

- Never mention Claude, AI, or LLM anywhere in git output — commit messages, PR titles, PR bodies, branch names
- Never include `Co-Authored-By` lines mentioning Claude or any AI
- Never add "Generated with Claude Code" or similar footers to PRs
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
  - `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Only commit when explicitly asked
